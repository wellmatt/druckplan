# jQuery Scrollbar Slider

(This project has been created in 2008, I just decided to move it to github)

Anchor become a really useful tool when you have to link to somewhere in a page with thousands of words, this unfortunately happen too often in corporate website.

Only problem is, an anchor is just plain bad in design, when a user click on a link he pretty much think he’s gonna go to another page, but in this case, he just jump down the content, this can be really disorienting, even for power users like us, when it is not clear if a link is an anchor and not a normal link.

## 3 simple steps to get this to work in your site

Step 1: Plug the jquery library, and my script in your head document.

Step 2: in your anchor link add the class anchorLink 
    <a href=”#anchorTarget” class=”anchorLink”>

Step 3: in your anchor target put an id and a name for your html anchor. 
    <a name=”anchorTarget” id=”anchorTarget” >
